A powerful earthquake struck central Turkey and northwestern Syria, leaving thousands dead and many more injured. The 7.8-magnitude quake, one of the strongest to hit the region in a century, toppled buildings and infrastructure, causing widespread devastation. Rescue teams from around the world have rushed to assist in searching for survivors trapped under rubble. The disaster has put immense pressure on emergency services, particularly in war-torn Syria, where humanitarian aid was already scarce. Officials have declared a state of emergency in several provinces, with freezing temperatures complicating rescue efforts. International organizations, including the United Nations and Red Cross, are mobilizing aid and resources to help affected communities. Experts warn that aftershocks could continue for weeks, posing additional risks to rescue operations and already unstable buildings.
